# Data Analytics Practise

## Technical Requirements:

1. Python
   - pandas, numpy
   - matplotlib, seaborn
2. Github

## Domain Knowlegde

1. Through each project, we focus on researching domain knowledge to understand why that information is there. As well as analysis orientation for the datasets found.
2. Based on the study of domain knowledge, we will better understand the expertise of the data analysis industry.

## Study Plan

1. Stage 1, choose simple data sets (1 file, few columns of data) and close to knowledge and preferences.
   - Simple processing on excel, csv, json files.
   - Understand domain knowledge and in-depth analysis.
2. Stage 2, choose more complex datasets (multiple files, wide knowledge domain).
   - Store data files into local and cloud database management systems (DBMS).
   - Directly query data from DBMS.
3. Phase 3, manually search datasets by scraping data from companies to perform analysis (eg tiki).
   - Assumptions: research on competitors, collect data...
