# Data Analytics Practise

## Technical Requirements:

1. Python (some libs are used a lot, more will be added):
   - pandas, numpy
   - matplotlib, seaborn
2. Github (This part is not very important for the job. We share and correct each other's exercises, so we need to know the basics)
   - Download link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Basic Tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/

## Domain Knowlegde

1. Through each project, we focus on researching domain knowledge to understand why that information is there. As well as analysis orientation for the datasets found.
2. Based on the study of domain knowledge, we will better understand the expertise of the data analysis industry.

## Study Plan

1. Stage 1, choose simple data sets (1 file, few columns of data) and close to knowledge and preferences.
   - Simple processing on excel, csv, json files.
   - Understand domain knowledge and in-depth analysis.
2. Stage 2, choose more complex datasets (multiple files, wide knowledge domain).
   - Store data files into local and cloud database management systems (DBMS).
   - Directly query data from DBMS.
3. Stage 3, manually search datasets by scraping data from companies to perform analysis (eg tiki).
   - Assumptions: research on competitors, collect data...

## Structure

```
📦DA_Practise
 ┣ 📂.vscode
 ┃ ┗ 📜settings.json
 ┣ 📂2023-04-24-sample
 ┃ ┣ 📂datasets
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📜sample.csv
 ┃ ┣ 📜main.ipynb
 ┃ ┗ 📜main.py
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜README.md
 ┗ 📜requirements.txt
```

- The basic structure is as above
- But you don't need to care. focus on folder **_`2023-04-24-sample`_**.
- For each project, we will put in a folder with the format **_`YYYY-MM-DD-name`_**
  - Here, you will have a **_`datasets`_** folder to store data files.
  - **_`main.ipynb`_**, **_`main.py`_** are the part we will work on.

- Các bài tập sẽ hướng đến cập nhật CV cho DA, DE. Cho nên bạn cùng học hãy cố gắng nghen! :)))
